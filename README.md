# belly-button-challenge

Overview: This project involves the building an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset which catalogues the microbes that colonies human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare. The dashboard includes a Guage chart, bubble chart, horizontal chart and a summary of the metadata for the human that the sample came from.

Scope: In this report we have used D3 library from javaScript to read in sample.json from the url and based on the data – three different visualization are displayed based on the user input.

Technology used:

Plotly and D3 library from JavaScript to generates plot
HTML – page framework
Data restored in sample.json format  

Tasks Performed:

Displaying the top 10 OTUs found in an individual with horizontal bar chart i. Sample values – Values of the bar chart ii. Out_ids – labels for the bar chart iii. Out_labels – hovertext for the chart

Displaying each sample with bubble char i. Out_ids – x values ii. Sample_values – y values and marker size iii. Out_ids – marker colors iv. Out_labels – text values

Displaying an individual demographic information

Displaying weekly washing frequency of the individual with the Guage Chart
